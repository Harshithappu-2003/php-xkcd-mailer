XKCD Comic Mailer üìß
XKCD Comic Mailer is a PHP-based subscription service that sends a random XKCD comic to registered users every day. The system includes a two-step email verification process for both subscribing and unsubscribing, with all subscriber data stored in a flat file.

‚ú® Features
Email Registration: Secure user registration with a 6-digit email verification code.

Daily XKCD Comics: A CRON job automatically fetches a random XKCD comic and emails it to all subscribers every 24 hours.

Unsubscribe Mechanism: Users can easily unsubscribe through a verified, two-step process.

File-Based Storage: Uses a simple .txt file for storing subscriber emails, requiring no database setup.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Prerequisites
PHP 8.3+

A web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx)

A server environment with cron task scheduling enabled

A configured mail transfer agent (MTA) for PHP's mail() function to work
